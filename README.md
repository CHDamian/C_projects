# C and C++ projects
Here you can look at some of my projects written in C or C++ 

## Pointers and Parse (C)

Simple program where user can store elements on BST and every node have it's own BST (up to 3 in depth).


## Cannonical and raw mode - Board game Gamma (C)

Program creates a simple board game in console. User have two modes:
- Canonical: typical mode to put commands and confirm them with Enter.
- Raw: program creates visual board and user commands using arrows and keys without confirming  with Enter.


## Metaprogramming - Fibbonacci numbers (C++)

Library makes simple language and interpreter with Fibbonacci numbers as literals, using metaprogramming in C++ (use Clang to compile)


## Implicit Treap - Algorythmic task (C++)

Program solves algorytmic problem using implicit treap structure. We put people in row and mark each one of them with R or G. Then we have two operations:
- Operation O: We turn the row from position x to y.
- Operation ?: We check how many groups we can get from position x to y where two G people aren't next to each other


## Object-oriented Programming - Geometry (C++)

Library simulates 2D coordinate system with points, vectors and rectangles.

## Exception handling - Function_maxima (C++)

Class simulates a mathematical function with certain maxima. Project shows correct exception handling that there will never be a weak situation (in case of exception throwing object is the same as it was before calling the function).

## SOLID principles - Assembly simulation (C++)

Library to simulate assembly using object-oriented programming with SOLID principles.
